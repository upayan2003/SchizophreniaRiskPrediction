# Schizophrenia Risk Prediction

This project explores the use of Machine Learning (ML) models to predict the diagnosis of Schizophrenia, a complex mental disorder characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and erratic behavior.
The goal is to build ML models that can assist in predicting Schizophrenia based on patient data, helping in early detection and analysis.

## Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights from the dataset.
- Apply data preprocessing and feature engineering to optimize model performance.
- Remove highly correlated features with the target variable to avoid data leakage.
- Train and evaluate multiple ML models on the dataset.
- Compare models using performance metrics such as:
  - Classification Report (F1-score, Precision, Recall, Accuracy)
  - ROC-AUC values
